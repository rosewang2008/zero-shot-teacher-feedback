Consider the following classroom transcript.

Transcript:
{transcript}

Based on the classroom transcript, rate the teacher's mathematical explanations on a scale of 1-3 (low-high).Mathematical explanations focus on the why, eg. why a procedure works, why a solution method is (in)appropriate, why an answer is true or not true, etc. Do not count 'how', eg. description of the steps, or definitions unless meaning is also attached.

Explanation of ratings:
1: A mathematical explanation occurs as an isolated instance in the segment.
2: Two or more brief explanations occur in the segment OR an explanation is more than briefly present but not the focus of instruction.
3: One of more mathematical explanation(s) is a focus of instruction in the segment. The explanation(s) need not be most or even a majority of the segment; what distinguishes a High is the fact that the explanation(s) are a major feature of the teacher-student work (e.g., working for 2-3 minutes to elucidate the simplifying example above).
