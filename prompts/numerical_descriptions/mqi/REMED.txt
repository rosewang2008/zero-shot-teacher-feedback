Based on the classroom transcript, rate the teacher's degree of remediation of student errors and difficulties on a scale of 1-3 (low-high). This means that the teacher gets at the root of student misunderstanding, rather than repairing just the procedure or fact. This is more than a simple correction of a student mistake.

Explanation of ratings:
1: Brief conceptual or procedural remediation occurs. 
2: Moderate conceptual or procedural remediation occurs or brief pre-remediation (calling students' attention to a common error) occurs.
3: Teach engages in conceptual remediation systematically and at length. Examples include identifying the source of student errors or misconceptions, discussing how student errors illustrate broader misunderstanding and then addressing those erorrs, or extended pre-remediation.
